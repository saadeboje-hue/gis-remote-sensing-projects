GIS & Remote Sensing Projects

Repository showcasing my beginner projects in GIS, remote sensing, and Python for geospatial data analysis.
These projects demonstrate my growing skills in spatial data handling, visualization, and environmental applications.

Projects
1. Urban Vegetation Change (NDVI Analysis – Ondo, Nigeria)

Used satellite imagery (Landsat) to compute Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

Analyzed vegetation cover changes in Ondo West Local Government Area (2018 vs. 2024).

Demonstrated remote sensing workflow: data collection → NDVI computation → visualization → change detection.

2. Drainage Pattern of Ondo Town

Extracted drainage networks using OpenStreetMap + Python (OSMnx).

Visualized river/stream networks to understand hydrological features.

Practical example of using geospatial data for water resources planning.

3. Land Cover Classification

Experimented with supervised classification using Python/remote sensing data.

Classified land cover types (e.g., vegetation, urban areas, bare land).

Showcased application of geospatial machine learning methods.

 4. Africa Population Density (with Nigeria Highlight)

Created a choropleth map of population density across Africa using GeoPandas.

Highlighted Nigeria for regional comparison.

Demonstrated cartographic design and geospatial visualization.

Tools & Skills

Python: Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, OSMnx, Earth Engine (beginner level)

Remote Sensing: NDVI analysis, land cover classification

GIS: Hydrology, population mapping, geospatial visualization

Version Control: GitHub for project organization and sharing

Next Steps

Expand into GeoAI and deep learning for remote sensing.

Explore health geography and climate change applications.

Collaborate on research-driven geospatial projects.
